Assignment Description

For this assignment you will be writing search algorithms to locate a goal node(pellet) in Pac-Man.
All code should be written in studentcode.java. The code in pacmanbase.java should be understood and
can be used as a reference but SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED. To run the code, use the command line to run
    java pacmanbase [path_to_maze] [index_of_search]

-----------------
Provided Mazes
-----------------
"Mazes/pacmaze.txt"
"Mazes/pacmaze-2.txt"
"Mazes/pacmaze-original.txt"
"Mazes/pacmaze-3.txt"

-----------------
Search Indexes
-----------------
1: Random Search
2: Depth First Search
3: Breadth First Search


Part 1:
    Start by looking over the provided solution for Random Search. This will give you a base to write your search
    algorithms off of.
    Random search can be executed by running
        java pacmanbase
        or
        java pacmanbase [path_to_maze] 0


Part 2:
    Write the funciton for depth first search. 
    Depth First search can be executed by running
        java pacmanbase [path_to_maze] 1

Part 3:
    Write the funciton for breadth first search. 
    Breadth First search can be executed by running
        java pacmanbase [path_to_maze] 2

Part 4: 
    Create your own pacman maze and test your search algorithms on the maze. These Mazes will be used
    later on to test more advanced search algorithms.
